      <h2>What is the GIFT Platform?</h2>
      <div>The GIFT Platform is a set of tools, including this app, that lets you send and receive 'gifts'.</div>
      <div>It is a service provided by the EU-funded GIFT project, which is investigating ways to combine digital content with real cultural artifacts - museum exhibits, historical sites, and so on - to provide new ways for visitors to engage with heritage.</div>

      <h2>What is this app?</h2>
      <div>This app lets you send a 'gift' to another user. Gifts in the GIFT Platform are packages of digital content that you create for another user to experience when they are in a particular situation, e.g. near a specific cultural artifact.</div>
      <div>Using the GIFT Wrapper app you set up that situation, create the digital gift, and send it to the lucky recipient.</div>
